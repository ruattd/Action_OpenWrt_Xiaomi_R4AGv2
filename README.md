3. Default wifi SSID: WiFi_R4AGv2, Defulat wifi Key: password
4. If Router doesn't have DHCP enabled, you will need to manually assign IP to talk to your router:
For example:
    If router's IP is 192.168.N.2
    Manually assign your computer's ip to be: 
    192.168.N.88
    255.255.255.0
```

## How to Fix Breed Endless reboot (infinite bootloop)
Breed doesn't officially support R4A that might cause endless reboot to 192.168.1.1

### Telnet to Breed
 - Chinese users can refer https://www.right.com.cn/forum/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=8298740&page=1&extra=#pid18865861
 - Hold & press reset, power on, boot into Breed, then open cmd or terminal to telnet breed,
 - Use command: telnet 192.168.1.1,
 - Setup your local webserver, if your local machine address is 192.168.1.2 port:8080, place the sysupgrade bin at local webserver folder,
 
 - Use command to copy bin over to router: wget http://192.168.1.2:8080/sysupgrade.bin
 - ![Connecting to 192 168 1 28080  connected](https://github.com/MrTaiKe/Action_OpenWrt_Xiaomi_R4AGv2/assets/117250841/8604b1e3-045a-4e11-b1f0-e856cbe7abce)

 - Check and Verify the bin file size, Length: 10749035/0xA4046b (10MB), Saving to address 0x80001000
 - You MUST erase Enough Space for the bin file size from 0x180000 to 0xA80000.,Why 0xA80000? Big enought for 0xA4046b. Check yours! 
 - 0x180000 is set as the address where xiaomi would boot from in this case,
 - ![0x000000000000-0x000000030000 u-boot](https://github.com/MrTaiKe/Action_OpenWrt_Xiaomi_R4AGv2/assets/117250841/e460c611-ccd2-4398-89e4-844cfc8032a7)

 - Use command: flash erase 0x180000 0xA80000
 - ![Pasted Graphic 1](https://github.com/MrTaiKe/Action_OpenWrt_Xiaomi_R4AGv2/assets/117250841/5276b704-6fa5-41c2-b0b3-ad86447c91d7)
 
 - Use Command：flash write 0x180000 0x80001000 0xA80000
 - (Write from 0x180000 address, use data previously wget(saved) at 0x80001000, given writing space with size of 0xA80000)
 - ![Trying to boot firmware from 0x00180000 in flash bank 0 ](https://github.com/MrTaiKe/Action_OpenWrt_Xiaomi_R4AGv2/assets/117250841/1a1aea69-10ad-4e9f-8062-7b763c6dad8e)
 
 - Use Command：boot flash 0x180000  (Boot from 0x180000)

### Next Restart to breed Web interface
 - You need to enable environment configuration:

 - Restart again to breed Web interface,then you can add autoboot.command，and value: boot flash 0x180000
 - ![159202017-cc32b481-e048-4fa1-85cb-97ec550e10f5](https://github.com/MrTaiKe/Action_OpenWrt_Xiaomi_R4AGv2/assets/117250841/3f816b1c-7577-4ce6-95c8-3dc3678d6137)

 - This is to tell breed boot system from 0x180000.
### If you want to flash New Openwrt Bin, you have to repeat above methods from..telnet and commands again.
